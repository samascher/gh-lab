# Git and GitHub Intro Lab

## Introduction
> ***Note:*** *This is a pair programming activity.*

Let's apply what we've learned from class to share and update each other's code.  With a partner, you're going to alternate between who 'drives' and who 'navigates' while following the requirements under "Exercise" below. The goal will be to create a project, have a partner fork, clone, and edit the project, submit the changes as a pull request, and then have the changes merged.  

Feel free to look at the [earlier github lesson](https://github.com/den-wdi-2/git-and-github) for notes and helpful hints.

## Exercise

Partners will be referred to as partner1 and partner2.

#### Requirements

- Follow instructions below
- At the end you will each have an identical repository that you each have contributed to from your own computers.

### Part 1

**With partner1 driving:**

- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice` **inside your work folder**

- within that folder create the following files `index.html` and `style.css`
  - 'cd git-and-github-practice'
- copy and paste the code from the [starter-code](starter-code) from the `index.html` and `style.css` into your own
- Inside the `index.html`, we need to do a little re-branding change all of the occurrences of "Relaxr" to "Relaxor"
- initiate a git repository, commit your changes, and push to GitHub


**With partner2 driving, from their computer:**

- get your partners link to the GitHub repository and fork and clone it
- open the project and change the background color of the header and testimonial part of the page to a soft green
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner1


**With partner1 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface



### Part 2

**With partner2 driving**:

<!--This isn't the best design.  Rather than create a new folder, why don't we just have Partner 1 make some new changes and create a pull request? -->

- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice-two` **inside your work folder**
-  within that folder create the following files `index.html` and `style.css`
-  copy and paste the code from the merged pull request files (on your partner 1's GitHub repo) from each of the appropriate files to your own

>**Note:** Partner2 should now have the solution from Part 1 locally

- initiate a git repository, commit your changes, and push to GitHub

**With partner1 driving:**

- get your partner's link to the new GitHub repository - fork and clone it
- open the project and create a button below the "Join our Mailing List" one that says "Check out Something Random" that takes the user to a website of your choosing
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner2


**With partner2 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface

**Bonus**:

- use the [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) documentation to update partner2's local version of `git-and-github-practice` without copying and pasting any code
- push the updated local copy to GitHub

#### Starter code

We've given you the HTML/CSS needed to get going in the [starter-code](starter-code).

#### Deliverable

There is no screenshot for this lab.  You should have two separate GitHub repositories that have merged pull requests.
